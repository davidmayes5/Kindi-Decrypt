# Kindi-Decrypt

To say this is decryption software is very much an overstatement.  As of right now, I'm just creating Kindi Decrypt as a tool to help with working out simple substitution ciphers by letting the user visually see the letters he/she changes in a ciphertext.

_Instructions:_ Type a substitution cipher into the input box and click "Format."  You will see the ciphertext made into buttons with spaces under them.  Click a button and type a letter to make that letter appear under the button, in addition to all other buttons with the same letter.  To clear the letter under a button, click on it and press backspace.  If you want to edit the ciphertext that is shown in the buttons, click clear in the bottom right corner of the window.
